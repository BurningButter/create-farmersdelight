# How to contribute
- If you have a contribution, create an issue and describe what you are changing.
- Feel free to suggest whatever you want.
- For general suggestions or ideas you can still use the issues page.
- If you don't think that the templates fit your issue or suggestion (or are too lazy to fill them out) you *CAN* use the "Open blank issue" button in any context.
